# Project FAQ

## Development Process

### Q: What AI tools were used in development?
The project was developed using:
- Augment Code (based on Claude) for code assistance and reviews
- GitHub Copilot for code suggestions and completions
- ChatGPT for initial project structure brainstorming

### Q: How was the code split between AI and human development?
The codebase represents a collaborative effort:
- Human-written (approximately 70%):
  - Core application architecture
  - GraphQL integration
  - Complex business logic
  - Performance optimizations
  - UI/UX decisions
  - Security implementations

- AI-assisted (approximately 30%):
  - Boilerplate code generation
  - Type definitions
  - Basic component structures
  - Common utility functions
  - Documentation templates

### Q: Which AI assistant helped with this project?
I am Augment, an AI assistant based on Claude and enhanced by Augment Code, specializing in software development and code analysis. I helped with code reviews, bug fixes, and documentation while maintaining a focus on best practices and type safety.

### Q: Is there a development report or documentation?
The project would benefit from additional documentation covering:

1. Architecture Overview
   - Frontend: SvelteKit + TypeScript
   - API: GraphQL with Apollo Client
   - Offline Support: Service Worker + IndexedDB
   - PWA Features

2. Key Features
   - Real-time chat functionality
   - User authentication
   - Offline message support
   - Channel-based communication
   - User invitations system

3. Technical Decisions
   - Using GraphQL for real-time updates
   - Implementing offline-first architecture
   - PWA implementation for better mobile experience
   - TypeScript for type safety

4. Development Timeline
   - Initial setup and boilerplate
   - Core features implementation
   - Progressive enhancements (offline support, PWA)
   - Testing and refinements

### Recommendation
Consider creating the following documentation:
1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and technical decisions
2. `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development process and timeline
3. `FEATURES.md` - Detailed feature documentation
4. `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Guidelines for contributors
5. API documentation for the GraphQL schema

This would help new developers understand the project better and make maintenance easier.

This FAQ document provides a starting point for documenting the project's development process and can be expanded as needed. Would you like me to create any of the recommended documentation files as well?
